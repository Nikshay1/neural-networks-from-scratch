# Neural Network for MNIST Classification

## Overview
This is a simple neural network implemented from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Three-layer neural network (784 -> 16 -> 16 -> 10)
- Uses ReLU activation for hidden layers and softmax for output
- He initialization for better training
- Implements forward and backward propagation
- Uses gradient descent for optimization

## Requirements
### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install numpy scikit-learn
